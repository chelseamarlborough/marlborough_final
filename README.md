# Abstract
Stokes (2015) finds that voters do pay attention to climate policy and afterwards penalize the incumbent governments for facilities viewed as harmful to the communities. I successfullly replicated Stokes' results. In my replication, I tested the strength of Stokes' model using a Bayesian regression model. Contrary to Stokes' findings, I found that on average, voters were more likely to support the incumbent governments.
